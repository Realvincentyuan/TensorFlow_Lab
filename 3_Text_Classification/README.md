# 3 Text classification key points

- [ ]  Build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow.
- [ ]  Prepare text to use in TensorFlow models.
- [ ]  Build models that identify the category of a piece of text using binary classification.
- [ ]  Build models that identify the category of a piece of test using multi-class categorization.
- [ ]  Use word embeddings in your TensorFlow model.
- [ ]  Use LSTMs in your model to classify text for either binary or multi-class categorization.
- [ ]  Add RNN and GRU layers to your model.
- [ ]  Use RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs and CNNs in models that work with text.
- [ ]  Train LSTMs on existing test to generate text (such as songs and poetry).
