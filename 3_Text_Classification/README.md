# 3 Text classification key points

- [x]  Build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow.
- [x]  Prepare text to use in TensorFlow models.
- [x]  Build models that identify the category of a piece of text using binary classification.
- [x]  Build models that identify the category of a piece of test using multi-class categorization.
- [x]  Use word embeddings in your TensorFlow model.
- [x]  Use LSTMs in your model to classify text for either binary or multi-class categorization.
- [x]  Add RNN and GRU layers to your model.
- [x]  Use RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs and CNNs in models that work with text.
- [ ]  Train LSTMs on existing test to generate text (such as songs and poetry).
