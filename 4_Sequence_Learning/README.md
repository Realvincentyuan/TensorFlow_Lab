# Sequence learning key points

- [x]  Train, tune and use time series, sequence and prediction models.
- [x]  Prepare data for time series learning.
- [x]  Understand Mean Average Error (MAE) and how it can be used to evaluate the accuracy of sequence models.
- [x]  Use RNNs and CNNs for time series, sequence and forecasting models.
- [x]  Identify when to use trailing versus centred windows.
- [x]  Use TensorFlow for forecasting.
- [x]  Prepare features and labels.
- [ ]  Identify and compensate for sequence bias.
- [x]  Adjust the learning rate dynamically in time series, sequence and prediction models.
